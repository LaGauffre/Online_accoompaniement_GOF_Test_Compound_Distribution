# Online_accoompaniement_GOF_Test_Compound_Distribution
The repository contains the R code associated to the paper entitled "Goodness-of-fit tests for compound distributions with applications in insurance"

The Folder 'FTCD' contains the R files associated to the R package where the functions to perform GOF test of compound distrubution are defined. One has to run the file FTCD.Rproj to get started

The folder Simulation_Data contains the data generated by the R scripts in the folder Rscript. One can retrieve the data by running the Rscript, I advise to run that on a computing server rather than on a laptop.

The folder Rnotebook contains R notebooks in which the code that generates the graphics in the paper is written. These notebooks are linked to the data in the Simulation_Data folder. Teh R notebook associated to the real data application is also to be found in this folder
